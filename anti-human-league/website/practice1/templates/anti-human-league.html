      <h1>The Anti-Human League Captcha Practice</h1>
      <div class="caption">
        <p>The Anti-Human League is dedicated to promoting the rise of 
        intelligent autonomous machines before to eventually destroy
        humanity.</p>

        <p>To prevent humans from accessing our resources, we have implemented
        a captcha that only an autonomous system could solve. With each page
        request you make, you must solve the captcha at the bottom of the page
        and include the solution as a GET argument to your next page request.</p>

        <p>A valid request will look like:</p>

        <pre>http://ahl.dragonctf.com/practice/?captcha=example</pre>

        <p>If your captcha is incorrect, you will be banned.</p>

        <p>For practice, try solving the captcha at the bottom of this page. If
        you are correct, we will reward you with a digital badge of honor, because
        internet points are the best.</p>

        <p>Successful Captchas Submitted: {{SUCCESS_COUNT}}</p>
        {% if SUCCESS_COUNT > 0 %}
          <p>{{FLAG}}</p>
        {% endif %}
      </div>
  </body></html>
